# marine_iguana
This repository has the bioinformatic pipelines used to analyze the fecal microbiome and resistome of marine iguanas from The Galapagos Islands. Three analyses were done: 16S RNA sequencing (microbiome), SmartChip RT-QPCR (resistome and mobilome), and Shot-gun sequencing (metagenomics).
